# linux-rga

RGA (Raster Graphic Acceleration Unit) is an independent 2D hardware accelerator that can be used to accelerate point/line drawing and perform common 2D graphics operations such as image scaling, rotation, bitBlt, alpha blending, etc. This repository code implements the RGA user space driver and provides a series of 2D graphics operation APIs.

**ATTENTION!** Originally librga was published in Rockchup GitHub repository at https://github.com/rockchip-linux/linux-rga. Due to some unknown reasons this repository was removed from Rockchip account. In order to preserve access to librga sources code this repository was created. Have fun!
